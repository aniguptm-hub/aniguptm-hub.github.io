  <h2>Expense Manager. Learning by building</h2>

  <p>
    I am building a personal expense manager to understand how financial data can be
    parsed, categorized, and corrected automatically without relying on bank APIs.
  </p>

  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <p>
    Most expense trackers depend on delayed bank sync or manual entry.
    Email and notification data exists in real time, but it is noisy, inconsistent,
    and easy to misclassify.
  </p>

  <h3>What I am building</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email ingestion to capture transaction-related messages</li>
    <li>Parsing logic to extract amount, merchant, and transaction type</li>
    <li>Basic categorization with room for manual correction</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I am learning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why financial data is messy even when it looks structured</li>
    <li>How small edge cases break naive automation</li>
    <li>Why user overrides are as important as automatic rules</li>
  </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>UPI Lite looks like a wallet but behaves very differently underneath</li>
        <li>Why “payment successful” does not always mean money settled</li>
      </ul>
